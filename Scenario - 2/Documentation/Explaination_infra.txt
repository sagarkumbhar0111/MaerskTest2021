We will need to create terraform files (.tf files) for provisioning infrastructure
Files we need to create :
modules with diff required infrastrure
Vnet
 2 Subnet
 NSG to open port 80 and 443
 1 Window VM in each subnet
 1 Storage account

We need to create yaml file to create ci pipeline which will run tf code and apply the infrastructure

We can use vs code tool for creating above files.
